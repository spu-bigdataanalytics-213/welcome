# DS-610 - Big Data Analytics

## Course Description

Big Data (Structured, semi-structured, & unstructured) refers to large datasets that are challenging to store, search, share, visualize, and analyze. 

Gathering and analyzing these large data sets are quickly becoming a key basis of competition. This course explores several key technologies used in acquiring, organizing, storing, and analyzing big data. 

Topics covered include 

- Hadoop 
- Unstructured data concepts (key-value)
- MapReduce technology
- Pig and Hive
- NoSQL storage solutions like HBase, Cassandra, and Oracle NoSQL and analytics for big data. 

A part of the course is devoted to public Cloud as a resource for big data analytics. The objective of the course is for students to gain the ability to employ the latest tools, technologies and techniques required to analyze, debug, iterate and optimize the analysis to infer actionable insights from Big Data.

## Prerequisites

This course requires following courses to be taken before this course.

- Introduction to Data Science (DS-510)
- Data Analysis and Decision Modeling (DS-520) 
- Big Data & Data Management (DS-530) 

## Learning Outcomes

This course aims to teach you the following concepts.

- Understand the challenges comes with big datasets.
- Learn and use new algorithms to analyze large datasets
- Gain experience in tackling complex level big data problem
- Learn the big data ecosystem and be able to understand it's tools and methods.

## Attendence Policy

Due to COVID-19, there is no restriction on attending the lecture, however, attending the classes will benefit on your learning curve a lot more instead of watching lectures online. As said, here are the guides:

- We record the classes and you can always revisit or watch previous classes. Links will be shared.
- When attending to class, please keep your **camera on** and your **microphone off**.

## Academic Honesty and Student Conduct

Students need to submit **only their own original work** (e.g. Code, PPT, figures, visualizations…). Student need to familiarize themselves with the academic rules of the University. In case a student is found guilty under the act of plagiarism, his/her test or assignment will be graded zero. 

If plagiarism occurs twice, student will receive ‘F’ grade with immediate effect.  It is expected that everybody turns off/mute all devices that emit sounds and noises that may interrupt the class (e.g. mobile phones, pagers, watch alarms). If an occasion arises, in which a student may need to leave the class to receive a phone call (important call), use rest room or get drinking water, he or she should silently walk out without disturbing rest of the class. 

Working on assignments and project work, that belongs to another course is **STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED**.

Copying your colleagues code is **STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED**. All submissions will be submitted to autodetection plagiarism tool that our university provides!
